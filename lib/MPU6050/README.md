#MPU6050 Library

This library was derived from the MPU9250 library by hideakitai - [MPU9250 library](https://github.com/hideakitai/MPU9250)
The MPU9250 is a 9-axis sensor that features the 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis compass.
The 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer in the MPU9250 is the same sensor in the MPU6050 with slight differences.  
Modifications were made to conform with the MPU6050 data sheet and register map.

This library was designed for my flight stabilization system using the Arduino Nano and MPU6050.
