#MPU6050 Library

This library was derived from the MPU9250 library by hideakitai - [MPU9250 library](https://github.com/hideakitai/MPU9250)
The MPU9250 is a 9-axis sensor that features the 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis compass. The 3-axis gyroscope
and 3-axis accelerometer in the MPU9250 is the same sensor in the MPU6050.

This library was designed for my flight stabilization system using the Arduino Nano and MPU6050.
